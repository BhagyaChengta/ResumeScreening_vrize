Credit Risk Model Probability of Default (NPA Prediction) -\nProbability of the default Model is about describing the likelihood of a default over a particular time horizon. It provides a\nprobability estimate that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations.\nWorked on business requirement/model document for development of propensity model for Probability of Default.\ni). This will be responsible for providing analytics support across credit risk lifestyle initiatives: origination, portfolio/capital &\ncustomer risk management with collections & recovery.\nii). Worked on Statistical models Logistic Regression /Decision Trees in JupyterLab platform for scoring and batch processing\nusing Python Scikit learn, along with the performance of models.\niii). Compared & Selected best model based on ROC Curve & various other parameters like K-S statistics, Lift and Gain Charts.\niv). Made feature selection process faster using Pyspark and parallel processing.\n2. Predictive maintenance using machine learning models\ni). Predict possible/upcoming failure in manufacturing equipment. Detect anomalous behavior through sensor readings.\nii). Pre-emptive action based on anomalous behavior to avoid breakdowns.\niii). Saving in terms of both cost and effort.\niv). Reduced downtime and increased efficiency.\n3. Moderation Automation algorithm\nUsed Natural Language Processing on reviews to build G2s very first Moderation Automation algorithm to increase quality and\nefficiency of review QA. It helped in reducing Manpower hour involved in the process . Processes includes:-\ni). Used text analytics to detect Plagiarised reviews.\nii). Implemented Multi-lingual Transformers(B.E.R.T) to detect cross-Language plagiarised reviews.\niii). Conceptualized an algorithm to detect Gibberish reviews present in the database.\niv). Automated the whole of Moderation Automation process .\n4. Developed an efficient Dynamic pricing model for one of the largest Logistics Company in USA\nThis project involved one of the Largest Freight company in USA who acts as a broker between their Clients who wants their loads\nto be transported and the Carriers.\nThe Freight Company would get a quotation price by their Clients for the load to be transported between a Origin to Destination\npair and would negotiate that price (Carrier Paid Transportation Expense) with the Carriers. This was basically done by the Carrier\nRepresentatives in the Freight company by using their existing domain knowledge and their years of experience in negotiation.\nOur main aim was to develop an efficient dynamic pricing model which understands that given the factors involved, it can exactly\ncome up with a price that has to be paid to the Carriers. Responsibilities undertaken as a part of this project :-\ni) Developed the conceptual and analytical framework of the proposal, as well as the codes for the algorithm used for analysis.\nii) Implemented various ML model for all the lanes and the data was sequenced temporally.\niii) Used Random Forest , XgBoost , Ridge and Lasso models and took an ensemble approach on top of these models, to come up\nwith the best and efficient Carrier Paid Transportation Expense model.\niv) Checked the performance separately on Smooth and Non-Smooth Lanes.\nActivities\n \nTowards Data Science and Hackernoon publication. - Writer 2018 to Current\n | work with Towards Data Science and Hackernoon publication as a Technical Blogger. These are the biggest Machine\nLearning publication with an outreach of more than 100k subscribers.\ne Acouple of my blogs have received good appreciation from eminent deep learning personalities like Jeremy Howard (Deep\nLearning Researcher , President of Kaggle) and David Robinson (Chief Data Scientist at Datacamp) .\ne Achieved Rank 296/3714 on the Private Leaderboard in the Analytics vidhya hackathon.\n \nYes Bank - Guest Blogger\nYesBank selected my blog to cover about their mega Datathon event held at Bangalore.\nAnalytics Society Meetup\n| am part of Analytics Society Meetup at my workplace. My responsibilities involve brainstorming concepts of Deep Learning and\nmaking the participants understand my experience of solving a project using Deep Learning approach.\n", "annotation": [{"start": 498, "end": 504, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "PYTHON", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "SQL", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 511, "end": 512, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "R", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 513, "end": 525, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "DATA SCIENCE", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 526, "end": 553, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 554, "end": 561, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "TABLEAU", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 562, "end": 569, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "PYTORCH", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 570, "end": 575, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "KERAS", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 576, "end": 586, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "MATPLOTLIB", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 587, "end": 592, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "NUMPY", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 593, "end": 599, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "PANDAS", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 600, "end": 613, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "DEEP LEARNING", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 614, "end": 626, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "SCIKIT LEARN", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 627, "end": 640, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "AWS SAGEMAKER", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 641, "end": 668, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 669, "end": 681, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "TRANSFORMERS", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 682, "end": 686, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "LSTM", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 687, "end": 694, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "PYSPARK", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 695, "end": 710, "label": "SKILLS", "text": "MULTIPROCESSING", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}, {"start": 723, "end": 843, "label": "EDUCATION", "text": "Bachelor Of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Vellore Institute of 2011 to\nTechnology , India 2015", "propertiesList": [], "commentsList": []}], "user_input": ""}]
